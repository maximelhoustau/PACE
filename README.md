# End of first year project

The goal of this project was to build a neural network to implement a decoding Hamming code into IOT devices.

We first trained different neural networks with Hamming code, then we physically implemented it with analogic operational amplifiers on an electrical circuit. The operational amplifiers played the role of a neuron, with the different resistors connected consisting on setting the weights between neurons.
